# Fifa19_player_analysis
In the real world, buying and selling of football players takes place during the transfer window, 
based on the bids a player receives from a club. In our analysis, we have shown that a player’s 
market value is dependent on many factors like international reputation, age, nationality, 
positions, attacking and defense work rates. 
Using our analysis, a manager can decide on how much he can bid on a player, based on his 
current attributes and future potential. Also, when the manager receives a bid for his player, he 
can decide whether the bid is underpriced or overpriced and sell the player at profits for the club. 
Using our analysis 

• we have shown the bias between the market values of top 10 clubs (ranked by UEFA) 

• we have shown the bias between the top 10 ballon d’or players (ranked based on 2018 ballon d’or awards) 

• we have found the youngest player (age under 22) with the highest market value.  
  

• What are the skills, a manager needs to look for, while buying a player for a positon 

• We have identified the trend of market vakue with age, and have understood that player value peaks at the age of 30.
